## The case

The [OpenSCad files](cad/) are a totally parametric design. You can generate a grid of keys of any size by modifying the parameters. It is designed to be as low as possible.

## The firmware

The firmware is written in the [rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org). It is not (yet) as featurefull, robust and portabel as [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
